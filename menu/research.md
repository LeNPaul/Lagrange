During my undergraduate career, I was fortunate to work with Professor Tim Chupp, and Professor Ron Gilgenbach before 
eventually working with Professor Alec Thomas. With Prof. Chupp, I wrote my first scientific software, a charged 
particle tracking routine in a static magnetic field, and attended my first research group meetings. With Prof. 
Gilgenbach and his Plasma, Pulsed Power, and Microwave Laboratory, I learned how researchers operate in an experimental 
setting. As is canon for nuclear engineers, I also learned how to perform Monte Carlo modeling at the time, and was 
lucky enough to contribute to a published manuscript in Professor Thomas's group.  

My Ph.D. at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor culminated in a dissertation titled `Kinetic Modeling of Magnetic Field Dynamics and Thermal Energy Transport in Inertial Fusion Energy Plasmas
`. I worked with Professor Alec Thomas to discover novel mechanisms which cause magnetic fields to grow, interact, move, 
and dissipate. 

I was a postdoctoral researcher at UCLA with the Particle-in-Cell and Kinetic Simulation Center under the supervision of
Professor Warren Mori. Working at PICKSC taught me how large-scale collaborations between National Labs and Universities
 can be fruitful towards the development of scientific computing. As part of the Center's mission, we validated and 
 benchmarked a massively-parallel, MPI-C++-based plasma physics simulation software, and released it as open-source
 for the use of the greater plasma physics community.

I am currently a Research Scientist at Noble.AI in San Francisco, CA. Our team is responsible for the research and 
development of novel, deep-learning-based approaches to solve problems in science and engineering. Being in a software 
engineering environment has doubled my appreciation for documentation and continuous integration and testing. 

I have authored or co-authored publications in `Physical Revew Letters`, `Physical Review X`, and `Physical Review E` 
amongst others. I have contributed to open-source software (e.g. `Tensorflow`, `JAX`) and maintain projects of my own.
