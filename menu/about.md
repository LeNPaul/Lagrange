### About Us

We are a mixed Ukrainian-American family of four based in the Pacific Northwest (US), united by the opportunity and desire to explore a new path in living our shared values:
+ Consideration for all beings
+ Respect and appreciation of the natural world
+ Value of connection, sharing and community

The dream is to discover or help build a community ([ecovillage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecovillage)) that resonates with our values and aspirations â€” where we can contribute our skills, learn from others, and build a regenerative future for generations to come. We want to inform and inspire you in sharing our pursuit of **common unity**.
