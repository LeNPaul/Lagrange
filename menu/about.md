title: Welcome to my journal!

This is my personal space, where I write about what I'm learning in web design, branding, my freelance business, personal productivity and my journey in tech.

I hate to write. Writing is too hard for me; however, I love to make knowledge go viral.

### We can work together

Whether you have a well-designed brand for your business/organization or not, I can design a beautiful yet purposeful website for you that you can be proud of. [Click here](https://www.subdesigne.com) to learn more about my work.
