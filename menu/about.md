title: About me and this site 
---

Hello my name is Dani Lafarga! I am a computational science PhD student at San Diego State University and the University of California Irvine. I am currently a part of the Climate Informatics laboratory at SDSU and have invested most of my time on climate research. This website serves as a tutorial for the code used in the paper Three-dimensional EOFs based on OGCM Three-Dimensional Empirical Orthogonal Functions Computed From An Ocean General Circulation Model: Mode Visualization and equatorial Upwelling. You can browse through the different [logs](https://dlafarga.github.io/menu/writing.html) to find each code that produces 3D EOFs and the figures of that paper.
