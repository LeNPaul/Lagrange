Hi, I'm Vinh, an engineer working in agricultural robotics.
I plan to post here as a way to solidify my understanding and as a record to look back on later.
Hopefully you find something useful here!


About this web site: it is a fork of the [Lagrange](https://github.com/lenpaul/lagrange) Jekyll template which is hosted on GitHub pages, supporting LaTeX and disqus.
A huge thanks to the original author, [Paul Le](https://github.com/LeNPaul)!
