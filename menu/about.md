title: Hi, I'm John.
---

I'm a Mechanical Engineering student at the University of Minnesota, with interests in aerodynamics, energy efficiency, and neuroscience applied in CS.

### Computer Science

I started minor programming projects throughout middle school, later being accepted into my high school's IT Specialty program, taking classes such as:
- Advanced Computer Math
- AP Computer Science A
- Cisco Networking Fundamentals I and II
- Data Structures
- Database Design and management
- Advanced Computer Studies
- Advanced Database

### Mechanical and Electrical Engineering

I didn't get much into mechanical engineering until joining UMN's FSAE Active Aerodynamics and Engine Modification subteams. I plan on continuing the studies of aerodynamics alongside electronic components as well as efficiency of power throughout college both academically and extracurricularly.
