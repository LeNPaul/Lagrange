<p>Hello, my name is Dani Lafarga! I am a computational science Ph.D. student at San Diego State University and the University of California Irvine. I am currently a part of the Climate Informatics laboratory at SDSU and have invested most of my time on climate research. 
  
My spare time is devoted to the arts. I find comfort in dancing with lights or fire, modeling, and painting.</p>

<p> This website serves not only as a living document of my progress as a scientist but also as a tool to help replicate my research. Currently, there are a few tutorials for the code used in my paper Three-Dimensional Empirical Orthogonal Functions Computed From An Ocean General Circulation Model: Computing, Visualization and Interpretation. You can browse through the different <a href="[url](https://dlafarga.github.io/menu/writing.html)">logs</a> to find each code that produces 3D EOFs and the figures of that paper. </p>
