Hi! I'm **Riad Afridi Shibly**. I'm a 4th-year **Mechanical Engineering** student at Khulna University of Engineering and Technology, Khulna.

Even though I am studying mechanical engineering, I have a keen interest in computer science. I love problem-solving, and occasionally I solve programming problems in various Online Judge.

I have been using Linux for about 4 years now. Currently, I am using [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org) as my primary operating system. I prefer command line tools over graphical one. There's no specific reason for that. Most of the time they suck less than a graphical one. My primary text editor is [vim](https://www.vim.org). I write everything or almost everything in [vim](https://www.vim.org). I use Google Docs and Google spreadsheet as a replacement of Microsoft Office. Using [pandoc](http://pandoc.org) is fun. I try to use it to write docs and make presentation.

I enjoy exploring new things. Most of the time they backfire [sad emoticon]. I love coding, cycling and reading. I browse [Quora](https://quora.com) a lot. Even though I don't ask questions, I prefer reading. Silent reader you can say.

I am active on Telegram. [t.me/shibly](https://t.me/shibly). If you have any query you can simply ask me on telegram. Have a Good Day, Sir.
