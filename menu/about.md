Hello my name is Dani Lafarga and I am a computational science masters student at San Diego State University. I did my undergraduate degree at the University of California San Diego and have since invested most of my time into climate research. You can find a comprehesive log of my progress in my [Climate logs](https://dlafarga.github.io/menu/writing.html).
