<p>Hello, my name is Dani Lafarga! I am a computational science Ph.D. student at San Diego State University and the University of California Irvine. I am currently a part of the Climate Informatics laboratory at SDSU and have invested most of my time on climate research. </p>

My spare time is where I tend to explore my creativity. If I am not working at a music festival you can find me dancing with lights or fire, modeling, painting, or making music. 

This website serves not only as a living document of my progress as a scientist but also as a tool to help replicate my research. Currently, there are a few tutorials for the code used in my paper Three-Dimensional Empirical Orthogonal Functions Computed From An Ocean General Circulation Model: Computing, Visualization and Interpretation. You can browse through the different [logs](https://dlafarga.github.io/menu/writing.html) to find each code that produces 3D EOFs and the figures of that paper.
