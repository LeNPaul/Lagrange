title: About Me
---

Hello World, my name is Archis Joglekar. I like to spend much of my time thinking about 
partial differential equations, high-performance computing, writing modular scientific software, fusion energy, 
deep learning, differentiable programming, and so on ... (in no particular order)

When I'm not doing that, you can find me somewhere in the great outdoors of California on a kayak in the open sea 
or hiking a mountain, or in the kitchen crafting meals with my partner.
