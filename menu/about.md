Hi, I'm Vinh, an engineer working in agricultural robotics.
I mostly work in computer vision and robotics, but I still love tinkering with hardware.


I was a co-founder at Traptic doing robotic strawberry harvest, which is now a part of Bowery Farming.
I did my BS in Aerospace Engineering at the University of California, San Diego and my MS in Computer Science from Georgia Tech specializing in Computational Perception & Robotics.


I plan to post here as a way to solidify my understanding and as a record to look back on later.
Hopefully you find something useful here!
