title: Hi, I'm John.

I'm a Mechanical Engineering student at the University of Minnesota, with interests in [active] aerodynamics, energy efficiency, and neuroscience applied in CS.

### Computer Science

I started minor programming projects throughout middle school, later being accepted into my high school's IT Specialty program, taking classes such as:
- Advanced Computer Math
- AP Computer Science A
- Cisco Networking Fundamentals I and II
- Data Structures
- Database Design and management
- Advanced Computer Studies
- Advanced Database

### Mechanical and Electrical Engineering

I didn't get much into mechanical engineering until joining UMN's FSAE Active Aerodynamics and Engine Modification subteams. I plan on continuing the studies of aerodynamics alongside electronic components as well as efficiency of power throughout college both academically and extracurricularly.

### Clubs and Activities

Starting freshman year of high school, I participated in ILITE [CyberPatriot]({{ site.github.url }}{https://www.uscyberpatriot.org/}) competitions, involving the securing and defense of linux, windows, and cisco systems, this continued through the next two years, eventually becoming Linux Lead, teaching security concepts for Ubuntu.

Junior year, I joined [ILITE FRC Robotics]({{ site.github.url }{https://ilite.us/}) as a programmer, working with control systems, becoming Programming Lead the following year.

Currently, I participate in [UMN FSAE]({{ site.github.url }{https://gophermotorsports.com/}), as a member of the Engine and Aerodynamics subteams, working with internals modifications and the active aerodynamics components of the car.
