I'm Vinh, an engineer working in computer vision and robotics.
My background is originally in hardware and I still love to tinker.
That's me on the left, and my friend/co-founder [Lewis](https://twitter.com/lewisdotai) on the right.


I did my BS in Aerospace Engineering at the [UCSD](https://ucsd.edu/) and my MS in Computer Science from [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/) specializing in Computational Perception & Robotics.
After working in commercial aerospace for about 5 years, I co-founded [Traptic](https://www.traptic.com/) with Lewis doing outdoor robotic strawberry harvest.
I now work at [Bowery Farming](https://boweryfarming.com/) (indoor, vertical farming) following the [acquisition](https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/16/following-acquisition-by-bowery-traptics-strawberry-picking-robotics-move-into-vertical-farming/).


I plan to post here as a way to solidify my understanding and as a record to look back on later.
If you need to get in touch, I can be reached at "pvphan90 at gmail dot com".
Hopefully you find something useful here!
