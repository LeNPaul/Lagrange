**Survey results presented at the Second Data Champions meeting.**

On the 21st May 2019, the TU Delft Data Champions held their second meeting. I was invited to present the results of the Research Data Storage survey, held earlier in the year.

You can read all about the Data Champions meeting, and find my presentation, in this [blog post](https://openworking.wordpress.com/2019/07/03/the-second-tu-delft-data-champions-meeting/)
by Esther Plomp, Maria Cruz, Marta Teperek, Santosh Ilamparuthi and Yasemin Turkyilmaz-van der Velden.

The results are also publically available on [GitHub](https://github.com/sebranchett/2019-Survey-Data-Storage-Requirements).
