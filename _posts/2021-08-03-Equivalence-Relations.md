Let $S$ be a set. Recall a partition of $S$ is a collection of non-empty pairwise disjoint subsets with union $S$. 

Any partition $P$ of $S$ gives a relation $a\sim_P b \overset{\text{def}}{\iff} (a,b \text{ are in same element of }P).$

One naturally wonders what $ \{ \sim_P \, : P\text{ a partition of }S \} $ is. Some thought reveals it is $\{ \text{reflexive, symmetric, transitive relations on } S \}$. 

Reflexive symmetric transitive relations are traditionally called "Equivalence relations".
