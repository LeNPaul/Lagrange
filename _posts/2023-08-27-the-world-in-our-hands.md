Apologies for the delay in updates since the start of the trip, it's been quite a ride so far. We are taking the planned halfway break from travel visiting family and friends in Ukraine and finally found the time and motivation to finish a post. Here's an update on the EU destinations so far and some photos at the end. Sending good vibes to all! üé∂‚ù§Ô∏è 

## Germany
   - Munich area
We arrived in Munich jet-lagged and were warmly welcomed by our incredibly hospitable friends whom we met in Sacramento years ago. They took us to a lake with a beer garden (of course) and promised we would try some of the best bread in the world, which after tasting artisan bread from a number of countries... seems to be true. The grain came from a field near the bakery and most loaves were dark and sourdough. We'd probably visit again just to eat the bread. One thing we noticed where we visited in Bavaria was small field sizes compared to other countries, with wildflowers planted along the edges of the field. From what we have seen, herbicides do not seem to be used widely on public land or around crops. The water also tasted very clean and we were ensured by our friends of the high quality of the water in their area. Some other points to note were the difficulty of using foreign credit cards and complexity of some self-service kiosks, and the seemingly spotless appearance of public places around Bavaria.
   - [GEN European Ecovillage Gathering](https://ecovillagegathering.org/)
The GEN (Global Ecovillage Network) Europe gathering took place this year at [Nature Community](https://nature.community/). Our gathering experience is hard to put into words but to try and share, here's a [video from GEN Europe](https://youtu.be/syxFDTvYHDI?si=JtYmoQYqODTFtrDG). Overall, it was energizing and informative, inspiring and fulfilling. For the kids, they seemed at home in community, disappearing for hours at a time, gaining confidence and friends from around the world. As hoped, the connections and knowledge gained have already refined our plans for the rest of the trip.
