Apologies for the delay in updates since the start of the trip, it's been quite a ride so far. We are taking the planned halfway break from travel visiting family and friends in Ukraine and finally found the time and motivation to finish a post. Here's an update on the EU destinations so far and some photos at the end. Sending good vibes to all! üé∂‚ù§Ô∏è 

## Germany
   - Munich area
We arrived in Munich jet-lagged and were warmly welcomed by our incredibly hospitable friends whom we met in Sacramento years ago. They took us to a lake with a beer garden (of course) and promised we would try some of the best bread in the world, which after tasting artisan bread from a number of countries... seems to be true. The grain came from a field near the bakery and most loaves were dark and sourdough. We'd probably visit again just to eat the bread. One thing we noticed where we visited in Bavaria was small field sizes compared to other countries, with wildflowers planted along the edges of the field. From what we have seen, herbicides do not seem to be used widely on public land or around crops. The water also tasted very clean and we were ensured by our friends of the high quality of the water in their area. Some other points to note were the difficulty of using foreign credit cards and complexity of some self-service kiosks, and the seemingly spotless appearance of public places around Bavaria.
   - [GEN European Ecovillage Gathering](https://ecovillagegathering.org/)
The GEN (Global Ecovillage Network) Europe gathering took place this year at [Nature Community](https://nature.community/). Our gathering experience is hard to put into words but to try and share, here's a [video from GEN Europe](https://youtu.be/syxFDTvYHDI?si=JtYmoQYqODTFtrDG). Overall, it was energizing and informative, inspiring and fulfilling. For the kids, they seemed at home in community, disappearing for hours at a time, gaining confidence and friends from around the world. As hoped, the connections and knowledge gained have already refined our plans for the rest of the trip.

## Denmark
   - Copenhagen
     Copenhagen was the "smallest" big city we've ever visited. There seemed to be more bikes than cars, with an extensive bike path network, including in more rural areas. It's a bike paradise - bike paths, protected bike lanes, bike traffic signals... who wouldn't want to bike in a place like that? Copenhagen had lots of charm, including some of the best plant-based treats we've ever had (fleurbolle, chocolate croissants, and danishes... which they call 'Vienna bread'). The only unpleasant thing was all the smoking in public places, which seemed to be excessive for what we're used to experiencing. The best part was the kindness, consideration, patience and good nature of the Danes we met. Two of the communities we visited were thanks to the personal connections made at the gathering.
   - [Dyssekilde](http://www.dyssekilde.dk/uk)
   Dyssekilde, also called the 'organic village' is a community of about 200 people and less than 100 houses which started about 30 years ago on a potato field. It's now a unique collection of eco and natural homes, gardens and play areas throughout, and some local enterprises (bakery, store, restaurant, etc). Along with eco buildings, they have green infrastructure including an approved willow greywater treatment system and windmill. They have grown and become more like a sustainable traditional neighborhood which has inspired many, including a new similar community across the street. The coastal location is near the sandy beaches of the North Sea with refreshingly cold water that Danes seem to enjoy. Some of us especially enjoyed seeing wheat fields full of corn flowers and poppies, and wildflowers planted alongside fields. Riding bikes in the area was pure joy.
   - [Avno Oasis](https://avno-oasis.dk/)
Avno Oasis was the most closely connected community we have been to so far with 10-20 people sharing 3 meals a day. It felt like a big family.
