Apologies for the delay in updates since the start of the trip, it's been quite a ride so far. We are taking the planned halfway break from travel visiting family and friends in Ukraine and finally found the time and motivation to finish a post. Here's an update on the EU destinations so far and some photos at the end. Sending good vibes to all! 🎶❤️ 

## Germany
   - [European Ecovillage Gathering](https://ecovillagegathering.org/)
   - [Nature Community](https://nature.community/)

Our gathering experience is hard to put into words but to try and share, here's a [video from GEN Europe](https://youtu.be/syxFDTvYHDI?si=JtYmoQYqODTFtrDG). Overall, it was energizing and informative, inspiring and fulfilling. For the kids, they seemed at home in community, disappearing for hours at a time, gaining confidence and friends from around the world. As hoped, the connections and knowledge gained have already refined our plans for the rest of the trip.


## Denmark
   - Copenhagen
