Apologies for the delay in updates since the start of the trip, it's been quite a ride so far. We are taking the planned halfway break from travel visiting family and friends in Ukraine and finally found the time and motivation to finish a post. Here's an update on the destinations so far and some photos at the end. Sending good vibes to all üé∂‚ù§Ô∏è 

## Germany
The [gathering](https://ecovillagegathering.org) is hard to put into words but to try and convey what it was like, here's a [video from GEN Europe](https://youtu.be/syxFDTvYHDI?si=JtYmoQYqODTFtrDG). It was incredible to see our kids at home in community, disappearing for hours at a time, gaining confidence and friends from around the world. As we expected, the connections and knowledge gained changed our plans for the rest of the trip.
## Denmark


## Sweden

## Ukraine
