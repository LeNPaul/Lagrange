Hi, I'm James Tran. I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Toronto where I've been studying *TP53* - the most commonly mutated gene in cancer - and how mutations in the gene can cause cancer predisposition.

I believe that biology is fundamentally interesting; each cell, protein, and gene plays a role in affecting our lives, as long as we look close enough and have a basic scientific understanding.
