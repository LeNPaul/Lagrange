Sea surface temperatures (SST) is studied more often than deep sea temperatures. More recently there has been more interest in deep ocean temperatures, but there has been a limitation due to the lack of measurement in those areas. The objective of this NERTO research is to make a high-resolution reconstruction of deep ocean temperatures of surfaces up to 5,500 meters depth at Â¼ degree spatial resolution and 10-day time resolution with 33 layers from year 2000 to present.
