Some links, questions, confusions. 

> Necessity is the mother of invention, so... confusion is the mother of understanding ? In that sense I suppose its ok to be confused, as long as one is self-aware :)

* [Grothendieck on being alone](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/4rujne/alexander_grothendieck_on_learning_to_be_alone/).   
Also, [Andre Weil on being alone](https://youtu.be/1RwkqZ6JNeo)

* [Mathematics in India, Post-Independence](https://twitter.com/bhavanamagazine/status/1559056793183350785?s=21&t=6SzMQSlouj1_loFr9bGW6Q) 

* [Game of life ?]   
It appears: We're in a game/race where positive points are sensory firings making one feel pleasure and negative points are sensory firings making one feel pain. There seems to be no final goal, other than for each person to try maintain a nice score till the end. 

* [Human actions ?] 
Our judgements are not really our own, but of all the things which constantly conditioned us. And judgements decide actions.   
Perhaps: Hold on to scientific truths, and understanding (avoid doing to others what you wouldn't want someone else do to you); and act by them.
