**Lec-1**: 

Consider the problem of numerically computing the integral of an ${ f : [0,1] ^d \to \mathbb{R} }.$   
Breaking ${ [0,1] ^d }$ into (axis aligned) cubes of width ${ \epsilon },$ there are about ${ N \approx (\frac{1}{\epsilon}) ^{d} }$ many such smaller cubes. Now the integral ${ \int _{[0,1] ^d} f(x) dx \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum _{1} ^{N} f(x _i) }$ where the ${ N }$ many ${ x _i }$s are each points from the ${ N }$ smaller cubes.   
In the Monte-Carlo method, instead of having ${ x _i }$s taken from the smaller cubes, they are considered as random variables ${ x _1, \ldots, x _N \overset{\tilde}{iid} x \tilde \text{Unif}[0,1] ^d }.$
