**Lec-1**: 

Consider the problem of numerically computing the integral of an ${ f : [0,1] ^d \to \mathbb{R} }.$ 

Breaking ${ [0,1] ^d }$ into (axis aligned) cubes of width ${ \epsilon },$ there are about ${ N \approx (\frac{1}{\epsilon}) ^{d} }$ many such smaller cubes. Now the integral ${ \int _{[0,1] ^d} f(x) dx \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum _{1} ^{N} f(x _i) }$ where the ${ N }$ many ${ x _i }$s are each points from the ${ N }$ smaller cubes. 

In the Monte-Carlo method, instead of having ${ x _i }$s taken from the smaller cubes, they are considered as random variables ${ X _1, \ldots, X _N \stackrel{iid}{\sim} \text{Unif}[0,1] ^d }$ and the random variable ${ \frac{1}{N} \sum _{1} ^{N} f(X _i) }$ approximates (i.e. is an estimator of) ${ \int _{[0,1] ^d} f (x) dx }.$   
Notice expectation ${ \mathbb{E}[\frac{1}{N} \sum _{1} ^{N} f (X _i)] }$ ${ = \mathbb{E}[f(X)] = \int _{[0,1] ^d} f(x) dx }$ where ${ X \sim \text{Unif}[0,1]  ^{d} }.$ Also, the mean squared error ${ \mathbb{E}[ \left( \frac{1}{N} \sum _{1} ^{N} f(X _i) - \int _{[0,1] ^d} f(x) dx \right) ^2]  }$ ${ = \text{var} \left( \frac{1}{N} \sum _{1} ^{N} f (X _i) \right) }$ ${ = \frac{1}{N ^2} \text{var}(\sum _{1} ^{N} f (X _i) ) }$ ${ = \frac{1}{N} \text{var}(f(X)) },$ which is ${ \leq \frac{1}{N} \int f ^{2} (X) dx }$ ${ \leq \frac{1}{N} \lVert f \rVert _{\infty} ^{2} }.$ So standard deviation (root of mean squared error) of the estimator is ${ O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}) }.$ 

**Lec-2**: 

A set ${ T \subseteq \mathbb{R} ^n }$ is convex if for all ${ x, y \in T }$ the segment ${ [x,y] = \lbrace x + t(y-x) : t \in [0,1] \rbrace \subseteq T }.$

Intersection of any family of convex sets is convex. For ${ T \subseteq \mathbb{R} ^n }$ its convex hull is ${ \text{conv}(T) = \cap \lbrace \text{convex sets containing } T \rbrace }$ (the smallest convex set containing ${ T }$).  

Obs: Let ${ T \subseteq \mathbb{R} ^n }.$ Now ${ \text{conv}(T) = \lbrace \text{convex combinations of } z _1, \ldots, z _m \in T \text{ for } m \in \mathbb{Z} _{> 0} \rbrace }$
