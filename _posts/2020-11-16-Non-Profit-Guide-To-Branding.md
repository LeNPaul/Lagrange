When you are building a nonprofit, one of the first things you need to consider is branding. How you can properly brand for you to create the right impression you want. But often, nonprofits ignore it, whether out of ignorance or they just don’t care. So their lack of consciously creating a good branding system hit their reputation and dent its value perception.  

## Logo Is Not Branding
Many people thought when you create a logo, that’s it, you are done. But a logo is just one element of the whole branding ecosystem. There are over 10 brand touch points there is, but in this guide, I’m going to talk about a few of the basics you need to get started. 

## Start With Choosing Your Colors
As a small nonprofit, one the thigs you need to do is selecting colors. Choosing color is fun, but sometimes it’s difficult to get the right matching colors for your brand. People find it difficult to choose the right colors that will invoke the feeling that they would want people to get about them.

To choose the right color for your nonprofit, you need to understand some colors and their meanings. You don’t want to choose red, yellow and blue, except if your nonprofit is about children. These are the primary colors; they are all too often found in children’s books.  

To help you speed thing up, you can use a color wheel or have a designer help you match the colors that will best give you the look and feel that you want. 

Be conscious about using colors. Don’t just throw colors on your print and digital designs. If you use a consistent branding color on all your designs, it will tie everything together and give it a unifying look. Your brand should be memorable and cohesive. 

## Typeface (Fonts)
The second most important aspect you need to consider is fonts. For colors, almost all nonprofits choose colors because that’s highly visual and forget about fonts. 
Fonts are very important because it’s used in every aspect of communicating your brand message. We use it to communicate every day, but we’re not conscious of its usage. My recommendation is, choose 1–3 fonts.

We have different types of fonts, and choosing the ones that will contrast is daunting. First off, I must tell you to stay away from Arial, alvetical and Times New Roman. Except if you want your copy to look like it’s from the 1970s.

Sometimes, choosing just one font with a variety of family members is just what you’d need. You will have a concordant copy with lots of family to contrast. But if you can choose one serif and Sans-serif fonts, that contrasts, is the best idea. The main point here is contrast—difference, not similarities. 

If that’s the idea you go with, you must select one for your headings and the other for body copy. Consistently using your selected fonts on all your digital and printed materials will make you stand out of the crowd in your game. 

There are many other brand touch points like illustrations, images, sound, tone etc but these are the basic ones you want to start with. 

## Brand Identity
Brand or visual identities are all those elements that people see and also interact with about your nonprofit. We are going to talk about three identities I consider as the face of your brand. 

### Logo
Logo design is broad and it encapsulate a lot of conceptual thinking to come up with one. There are different kinds of logos with different designs, trends and patterns. Start by asking yourself about what you’d want people to think of you when they see your logo. And obviously that is narrowed in the story behind the logo.

Logos are not just ordinary symbols, but they depict a message. This is where creativity plays a big role. One thing to also note is make it simple. Often, people confuse visual complexity for beauty. But in design, less is more.  The less complex, clean and elegant your design is, the beautiful. 

### Letterhead, business card and envelope
The best way to design these three things is to do it together with the same design layout. The reason for this is that you want to have a professional look that reinforces each other and makes everything unified and cohesive. 

Choose one alignment and structure on all three. You can put your logo at the top and contact info at the bottom right or left of the page.  

Who said they all have to be at the top of the page?

Don’t just type your business name in large fonts across the top and put your logo on the left and right of the page. You’re fine with just one logo, and it doesn’t have to also be at the center. Left or right is fine just make sure you’re conscious of it. 

You must try to make sure you stick to the same structure on all of them, that way when you give your business card to someone today and send them a letter next week, they’d instantly know it’s from you. They don’t have to even read your name to notice that. 

Don’t design everything separately and specially. If everything is special nothing stands out. 

### Website
Many organizations and small businesses, especially in developing countries don’t even bother to create a website. It’s whether they don’t know they need to design one or they think it’s too costly. 

But the case is not always like that. With codeless tools now available on the internet, you can even design your own website. Pick a theme that looks like what you want to create and change it to your own unique design.

I wrote an article about why every nonprofit, regardless of size, must design a website, read it here.

A website is also an excellent place to empower your brand to shine through and become more memorable. 

The key point here also is consistency. You should strive for a consistent header navigation and footer on all pages. You don’t want people to wonder whether if they are still in your website or they’ve unconsciously fallen in another land altogether. 

Colors and images are huge in nonprofit website design. You can experiment with your color palette here and create something unique. 

## Conclusion
Branding for nonprofits is very crucial, and it’s an essential aspect in a nonprofit setup. Be conscious of what you’re doing to brand yourself well. It’s about the way you communicate and how you want people to perceive you.  You want your brand to be recognizable and memorable, not the opposite.
