## Where?

Europe - 4 months, 10+ countries, 15+ communities.

At least that's the plan, for now, and we're leaving this week.

## Why?

You can read a bit more background in the new [About](http://commonunity.net/about.html) page, but I think this rural church lawn sign I saw sums it up nicely - *GOD HATES* ...hold on wrong one...

*BUILD A LONGER TABLE, NOT A TALLER FENCE*

The current model isn't working for us and many others. Here's some [suggested reading from Time](https://time.com/intentional-communities/) on the community movement. While we may end up right where we are now starting from scratch, the plan is to at least learn and experience from people directly involved in the movement.

We'll let you know what we find out and how long of a table we're gonna need.
