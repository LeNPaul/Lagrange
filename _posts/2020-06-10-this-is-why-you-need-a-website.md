## Introduction 

In this day and age, we have to expect that every business (big or small) has a website. Like so many other web users, I would first type your business name on google to know about your product or service, and to learn why I should do business with you instead of your competitor. You already know how I will feel if I can't find any information about your business. 

To start and run even a small business successfully these days is tough. It requires you to work the heck out of you day and night. It should always be a great concern to you, that you try your best to make a good first impression on your prospective buyer. 

Before I get down to the why let's first of all start with the what?

## What is a website? 

A website is simply a collection of web pages and related contents linked to each other, which is stored on a server and identified by a domain name. E.g., facebook.com, subdesigne.com, etc. Your website is your business's physical address on the internet that is opened 24/7 to everyone, everywhere. 

This post is _centred_ on the reasons small businesses must have a well-designed website, but organizations, etc. must also have too; it has enormous benefits for them. But that's another article I will write someday.

## 4 strong reasons your small business needs a website.

1. **Leads:**  If you have a website with the right contents and contact information about your business, the chances for you to convert visitors into buyers are very high. Your business is no longer in a fixed location where potential customers would need to visit to know about what you offer. As your customer base grows, you make more sales and profit. 

   Isn't it awesome?

2. **Credibility:**  You gain the trust of everyone who knows you have a website that can help them get the information they want without physically visiting your business place. That shows you are serious about what you do. 

   As you know, to sustain a small business in this competitive world of ours is hard. If you can spend some money and put in the time to update and maintain it in a way that it remains useful to your customers, you're credible. People can count on you to deliver products or services that will solve their problems the most effective way.

3. **Sets you apart from the crowd:**  A website that clearly shows your unique brand (colours, typography, icons, illustrations, logo etc.) elements sets you apart from your competitors. It reinforces your brand and makes it memorable to engage with. It also puts you a step further ahead of your competitors. 

   Foreigners who search for local products or services are most likely to find your website. If what you offer can conveniently solve their problems then they can contact you for business.  

4. **Saves you some time and money:** If you ever planned to do adverts for your small business (which you must do), you can save some money on paper and other advertisements that most times do not yield any benefits. 

   By simply going into content and email marketing with your website, and continually output good contents, you can reach a large audience. You can tell and show anything you want your potential customers to know about your business directly in their inboxes. That means you care about them and the value you bring to them. 

   You can also save yourself some time on responses to queries from your customers. Just by adding FAQ section on your page, you can handle most of the common questions your customer might have about your business or service.

   The above five points are enough reasons for any small business that wants to grow and take advantage of this digital economy and position themselves strategically in the right spot to consider investing in a website. 

## Conclusion 

Many small businesses, especially in Africa, are missing out a lot. They're probably afraid to invest in a website for their small business, either because they don't know if they need to have a website or they think that they don't have the tech skills to run and maintain it. The reality is, it is not that expensive to maintain a small business website considering the ROI you'll actualize. After all, it is worth it.
