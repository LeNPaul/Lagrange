A few days into our month-long journey through SE Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Alberta and BC, the morning was clear, cold and quiet. I was restless and ready to finally finish my “goodbye” work email, pacing around outside the van to keep warm, numb fingers tip-tapping the screen. Completing my final act as an employee of Nike Inc., I looked down to discover a lonely swoosh tag.

I picked it up and got packed for the hike - 4 backpacks, sweatshirts, water filter bottle, and chocolate coconut bars. With a fresh can of "Frontiersman" bear spray at my hip, I took my first steps along the gold-speckled snowmelt river at the base of the breathtaking sawtooth mountains, imagining Idaho bears in workout gear.
