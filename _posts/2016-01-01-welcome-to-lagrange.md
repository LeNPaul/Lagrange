I am a third-year graduate student in UC Davis' Biological Psychology Graduate Group working in the Trainor Lab. Although I am in the Psychology department, my interests lie within the realm of integrative biology, ecology, neuroendocrinology, and animal behavior. When not in the lab, I spend my time engaging in outreach, hiking, and playing with my cats.
