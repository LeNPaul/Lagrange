I"‘<p>Hi there! Iâ€™m Paul. Iâ€™m a physics major turned programmer. Ever since I first learned how to program while taking a scientific computing for physics course, I have pursued programming as a passion, and as a career. Check out <a href="https://www.lenpaul.com/">my personal website</a> for more information on my other projects (including more Jekyll themes!), as well as some of my writing.</p>
